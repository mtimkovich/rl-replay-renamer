# Rocket League Replay Renamer

By default, Rocket League saves replays as 32 character hexadecimal strings, which makes finding the one you're looking for a chore. This script renames those files to include game mode, score, and some other information to make it easier for our human brains to understand.

Before:

```
28E4E0FE49754D401B77288664EC770A.replay
```

After:

```
2024-01-27 19-26-08 | 2v2 | TrainStation_Dawn_P | 4-3 | 5m 23s.replay
```

Wow!
